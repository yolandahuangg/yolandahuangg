  I hope you can find something worthwhile here! I don't do much, but I love good food, bbt, anime, music and of course coding. For this account you will see most of my programming works, here and there, over the past few years. Python and Node.js is for sure my favorite languages out there (without contest), and I'm working towards software enineering in the future, even tho I type so SLOWWW.

  Btw in my spare time I also enjoy visual arts, particularly photography, as well as gaming! Ask me and we can definitely co-op in something ðŸ˜‹ <br><br>
